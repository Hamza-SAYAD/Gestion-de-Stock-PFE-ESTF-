* **Automated Stock Alerts:** Receive timely notifications when stock levels approach predefined thresholds, enabling proactive restocking and preventing stockouts.

* **Safety Stock Management:** Define safety stock levels for each item to ensure sufficient inventory even during unexpected demand fluctuations.

* **Flexible Inventory Valuation:** Choose from various inventory valuation methods (FIFO, LIFO, CMUP) to align with your accounting practices and financial reporting requirements.

* **User-Friendly Interface:** Enjoy a simple and intuitive interface that facilitates easy inventory management and data access.

**Benefits**
